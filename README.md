# 🧩 Problem Solving by Patterns (Python)

This repo is my **problem-solving journal**.  
I focus on **patterns** instead of random problems.  

📖 Each folder = 1 pattern (e.g., Frequency Counting, Two Pointers, Sliding Window).  
Inside each folder:  
- `README.md` → Pattern explanation, template, and mini drills  
- `.py` files → Problem implementations with step-by-step solutions

## Patterns (Work in Progress)
1. ✅ Frequency Counting  
2. 🔜 Two Pointers  
3. ⏳ Sliding Window  
4. ⏳ Prefix Sum / Running Totals  
5. ⏳ Sorting-based Problems  
6. ⏳ Hashing / Set-based Lookups  
7. ⏳ Stack / Queue Simulation  
8. ⏳ Dynamic Programming (basics)

## Why This Repo?
- 🚀 Build problem-solving skills with **clarity**  
- 🧠 Practice **thinking in patterns** (not memorizing)  
- 💼 Useful for **Data Engineering & Analyst interviews**
